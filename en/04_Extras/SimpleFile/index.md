## SimpleFiles - attach files to the page

### SimpleFiles - attach Evolution CMS files to the page.

Another addition based on DocLister and EasyUI. This time, files are attached to the page and edited in a table - as in MultiFiles, but a little more convenient (especially if we are talking about a large number of files) (:

To work, you need a https://github.com/AgelxNash/DocLister, as well as PHP at least 5.6.
