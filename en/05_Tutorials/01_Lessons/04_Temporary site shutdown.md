There may be a situation where you need to temporarily make your site inaccessible to visitors. MODx invites the owner to disable the site and notify visitors about the reasons and timing of this.

Log on to the site management interface by a user who has rights to change the site configuration. Go to The Administration -> System settings. Site availability settings are located on the first tab of the system control panel.

As long as the system identifies you as the site manager, you see your site in the same state as before. This makes it easy to disable the site for support purposes (for example, updating or adding modules, templates, etc.), but at the same time be able to see and test the changes made before it is seen by ordinary visitors. They will also see a special page, if you have specified it, or a special message.

If you do not specify which page to show to visitors while the site is disabled, then the system will automatically show a message that the site is not available.
