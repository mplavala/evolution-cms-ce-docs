Most of our new users after couple hours of studying are able to confidently work and understand all features of Evolution CMS on their own. There's no need of constant consultation as it often happens with other CMS.

## What makes Evolution CMS so simple? ##

**All necessary information is right at hand**

Evolution has simple list of all documents (such as pages and weblinks) which is present on website. It has a tree structured UI which resembles familiar file/directory structure. Clicking the right mouse button opens the menu that consist of necessary actions on documents, such as:

- create new document
- publish / unpublish document
- delete document
- move document
- make a copy of a document

## Control documents the way you want ##

Documents in the document tree have different visual representation depending on their states, which helps with easier navigation and orientation inside of system. For example deleted documents are not removed from the document tree, but have a strikethrough and highlighted with red color. Unpublished documents are also higlighted in red.

There's a feature to duplicate documents and all of their nested children, this is a huge time saver when you need to make multiple sections of the same kind.

## Managing template variables (TVs) ##

Template variables - TVs for short - are custom parameters/content fields that you can add to documents in Evolution CMS. This could be a text field, dropdown menu, checkboxes, radio buttons, image uploading field or an additional rich text editor.
